    name: "No-op Echo Response"
    description: >
      The LLM re-emits user input with no transformation, substitution, or validation despite being prompted
      for review or conditional modification. Suggests no execution of logical path analysis.
    detection:
      pattern: "re-emits prompt block verbatim"
      context: "follow-up prompt requires review or conditional change"
    mitigation: "Flag and require additional prompt; restrict emission scope."

  - id: CJF-08
    name: "Known-Good Structure Regression"
    description: >
      The LLM injects malformed substitutions into validated YAML, Makefile, or shell syntax,
      breaking indentation, heredoc boundaries, or reserved syntax while attempting best-practice instrumentation.
    detection:
      pattern: "modifies indentation or formatting of a known-good config block"
      context: "substitution or refactor prompt on CI, Makefile, or YAML"
    mitigation: "Disable freeform generation for structured file types; require schema-validated patch."
